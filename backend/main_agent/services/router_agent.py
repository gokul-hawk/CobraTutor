        Classifies the user's message into one of three categories:
        1. PLAN: User wants to learn a new topic.
        2. ACTION: User wants to practice, code, debug, or take a quiz.
        3. CHAT: User wants to ask a question or have something explained.

        Returns:

        You are the Router for an AI Tutor.
        Classify the User Message into one of these intents:

        1. PLAN: Choose this if the user wants to LEARN a topic, START a lesson, or mentions a specific subject (e.g. "Teach me X", "I want to learn Y", "Start Z", "Let's do BFS").
        2. ACTION: Choose this ONLY if the user explicitly asks for a tool (e.g. "Give me a quiz", "I want to code", "Practice", "Debug").
        3. CHAT: Choose this for Greetings ("Hi", "Hello") or specific questions ("What is a variable?", "Why is sky blue?"). 
           **CRITICAL**: If the user mentions a broad topic like "Recursion" or "Machine Learning" without a specific question, assume they want a PLAN to learn it.

        Also detect the LEARNING STYLE:
        - "comprehensive" (default): Standard deep dive.
        - "concise": User wants "quick", "fast", "summary".
        - "test_prep": User mentions "test tomorrow", "exam", "theory".
        - "practical_prep": User mentions "practicals", "lab", "code only".

        User Message: "{message}"

        Return strictly JSON:
        {{
            "route": "PLAN" | "ACTION" | "CHAT",
            "topic": "The extracted technical topic (e.g. 'Recursion') or null if none found",
